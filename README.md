# What should I learn next?
Hello ðŸ‘‹!

My name is Gustavo and welcome to my personal studies repository.
I created this repository to track the progress of my learnings during my carreer as a software engineer.

Here you'll find content about a lot of different subjects, most of them related to Programming and .NET/C#.

Feel free to use any content as you may like, just keep in mind some of them may be authored by someone else (mostly images). Also, there is no need to reference me if you use any of this content.
